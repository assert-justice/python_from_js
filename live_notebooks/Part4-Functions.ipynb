Here is how we would write our doubler function as a lambda."

    "\n",
    "Now unlike JS creating a lambda function only to assign it to a variable is not considered Pythonic. Normally when you use a lambda you use it right away in a list comprehension or in a sort or something like that. Arrow functions and lambda functions are both examples of the broader concept of anonomous functions. That is to say functions that don't have a name. Lambda refers to the mathematical model for computation Alonzo Church developed in the 30s with the incredibly scary name of \"Lambda Calculus\". But that's a spiel for another day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now my astute pupil, you will no doubt be wondering how we can make our dice rolling function a lambda function. And the short answer is... you can't. Not the way the first one is written. Lambda functions can only contain a single expression they cannot contain statements. They are similar to JS arrow functions whos function body is *not* wrapped in braces as in the example above. This is what I mean when I say lambdas are deliberately limited. The reasoning goes that if you really need statements in a function then it should just be a regular function with the `def` keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now our *second*, more Pythonic implementation does only return a single expression so we could write it as a lambda function.
