    "You're familiar with arrays and objects from JS. We can group data together in various useful ways like dynamic arrays, sets, key value pairs, and so on. These different structures are referred to as collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looping through the elements of an array or the keys in an object is a very common operation, common enough that it has been generalized into the concept of an \"iterable\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript collections had their own methods, functions bound to the object in question. Python has these too but if a concept is more general it is made into a standalone function that can be passed several different types of objects and knows how to work with each one. This concept is referred to as \"duck typing\" (if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's a duck, seriously) and if it seems abstract now I'll give lots of examples."
