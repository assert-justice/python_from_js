A design ethos of Python is \"There should be one, and preferably only one obvious way to do something\" and so they deliberately limit certain features to not compete with others. Let's take a look. Here is how we would write our doubler function as a lambda."

    "\n",
    "Now unlike JS creating a lambda function only to assign it to a variable is not considered Pythonic. Normally when you use a lambda you use it right away in a list comprehension or in a sort or something like that. Arrow functions and lambda functions are both examples of the broader concept of anonomous functions. That is to say functions that don't have a name. Lambda refers to the mathematical model for computation Alonzo Church developed in the 30s with the incredibly scary name of \"Lambda Calculus\". But that's a spiel for another day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now my astute pupil, you will no doubt be wondering how we can make our dice rolling function a lambda function. And the short answer is... you can't. Lambda functions can only contain a single expression they cannot contain statements. They are similar to JS arrow functions whos function body is *not* wrapped in braces as in the example above. This is what I mean when I say lambdas are deliberately limited. The reasoning goes that if you really need statements in a function then it should just be a regular function with the `def` keyword. Fair enough?"
